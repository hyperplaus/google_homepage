Hi everyone! If you are reading this file, it means I'm through with first mini-project on the_odin_project HTML/CSS section (the easy version). I gather that there should be some kind of really simple GET form and big rainbowish logo of one and only - Google.

13.02.2019 Set the repo, start working.
14.02.2019 Add pics, structure the page, start making layout
18.02.2019 Finish layout, upload to git
